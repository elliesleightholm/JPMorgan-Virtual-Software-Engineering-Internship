# Project 3 - Software Engineering Virtual Internship JP Morgan

In this project we display data visually for traders. We use JP Morgan's 'Perspective' to create a chart for a trader's dashboard.

Project Description: Use Perspective to generate a chart that displays the data feed in a clear and visually appealing manner for traders to monitor this trading strategy. You have to modify the existing live chart to be able to (1) track and display the ratio between the two stock prices (2) show the historical upper and lower bounds of the stocks' ratio (3) and finally, show 'alerts' whenever these bounds are crossed by the ratio.
